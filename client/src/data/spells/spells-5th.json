The wall is 1/4 inch thick and lasts for the duration. Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can't be dispelled by Dispel Magic. A Disintegrate spell destroys the wall instantly." },
  { "name": "Wall of Stone", "school": "Evocation", "castingTime": "1 action", "range": "120 feet", "duration": "Concentration, up to 10 minutes", "components": "V, S, M", "classes": ["druid", "sorcerer", "wizard", "artificer"], "description": "A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick. If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall, the creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall. If the wall is maintained for its full duration, it becomes permanent and can't be dispelled." }
